# CSS Grid Responsive Webpage

This is an implementation of an exercise in WesBos CSS Grid course
from around 2019

[The course](https://courses.wesbos.com/)

The implementation is mobile first and has some modern responsive css approaches that didn't exist at the time of the course and are relatively new now in 2026.
